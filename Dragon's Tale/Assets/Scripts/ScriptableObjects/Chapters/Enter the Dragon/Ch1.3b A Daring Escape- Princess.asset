  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: 'After months of being held captive by you, the Princess starts to get
    restless, obviously planning to run away. Finally, she musters up the courage
    to put her plan in action. To her credit, it is a great plan-- she just didn''t
    account for your superior intellect. How do you respond to her escape?


    a) Hunt her down and make her regret having tried to make a fool of you

    b) Let her go and wish her the best. She gave you plenty of good times to remember
    her by, and you''d rather not eat her.'
