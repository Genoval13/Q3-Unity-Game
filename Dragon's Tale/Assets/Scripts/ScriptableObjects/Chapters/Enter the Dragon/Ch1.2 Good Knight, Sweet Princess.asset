  storyText: 'Chapter 1.2

    Good Knight, Sweet Prince(ess)


    With the lovely princess squirming in your talons, you swiftly return to your
    lair to decide what to do with her. But before you have more than a few hours
    to ponder, a brash, rude Knight interrupts your thoughts by barging into your
    lair! "Return to me the Princess, and I may let you live, wyrm!" they declare
    pompously. You''ll show them, won''t you? How will you deal with this impetuous
    Knight?


    a) Roast them alive, then eat them (Yum!)

    b) Tear them to shreds with your claws (Ouch!)

    c) Seduce the Knight and convince them to give up on the Princess (What?)'

    endDesciption: You let loose a massive breath of a fire, roasting the Knight where
      they stand! After peeling off their armor, they make a lovely meal. A little
      stringy though...

  - keystring: b
    endDesciption: You tear into them with your freshly manicured claws, ripping them
      to bits for the birds. Good riddance, and don't bother anymore dragons!

  - keystring: c
    endDesciption: You, uh... seduce the Knight, pushing them over gently as they
      charge you. "Silly Knight," you say sultrily, plucking off one piece of armor
      at a time. The Knight gives in to your advances reluctantly, and you two head
      somewhere more private for a night they'll never forget... Next morning, the
      Knight rides back into the city, armorless. You decided to keep a momento.
