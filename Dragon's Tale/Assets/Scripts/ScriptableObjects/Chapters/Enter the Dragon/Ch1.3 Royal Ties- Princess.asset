  storyText: 'Finally, with the Knight dealt with, you have time to ponder what to
    do with the Princess. Will you:


    a) Eat her for tasty breakfast! Royalty always tastes the best.

    b) Ransom her for money! Gotta grow the hoard.

    c) Keep her around for entertainment! After all, it gets lonely in your lair with
    no one to speak to, and a Princess will surely provide pleasing songs and good
    conversation, at least for a few months.  '

    endDesciption: You decide to ransom her for a pretty penny. Being a dragon, it's
      only natural that you'd want to get as much gold as you could collect into your
      lair. The humans almost don't make the payment, though, and you're pretty sure
      you've bankrupted the kingdom, but what do you care? You're a dragon!

  - keystring: c
    endDesciption: You decide to keep her around for a while and see what they teach
      younglings these days. It turns out she's a talented songstress, dancer, philosopher,
      historian, and actress. You quite enjoy her presence, though after a few months
      you do start to bore of her.
