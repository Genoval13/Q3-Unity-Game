    Gender Equality


    So, as dragons are wont to do, one day you decide that you''d like to kidnap some
    royalty. Because you can. Traditionally, a majestic wyrm such as yourself would
    terrorize a kingdom into submission and nab a princess while you''re at it, but
    you find yourself with choices today. Lucky you! Do you:


    a) Stick with tradition and kidnap a beautiful princess

    b) Break tradition and go for a handsome prince? After all, this is a gender equal
    society we live in, so why shouldn''t he be fair game too?'
