  m_Name: Ch1.3b A Daring Escape- Prince
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: 'After months of being held captive by you, the Prince starts to get
    restless, obviously planning to run away. Finally, he musters up the courage to
    put his plan in action. To his credit, it is a great plan-- he just didn''t account
    for your superior intellect. How do you respond to his escape?


    a) Hunt him down and make him regret having tried to make a fool of you.

    b) Let him go and wish him the best. He gave you plenty of good times to remember
    him by, and you''d rather not eat him.'
